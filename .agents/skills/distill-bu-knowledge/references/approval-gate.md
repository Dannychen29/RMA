# Knowledge approval gate

Ask the participant to review only the canonical `BRD.html`, unresolved material gaps and the proposed approval scope.

On approval:

1. Copy the canonical machine artifacts to a new immutable version under `30_approved/`.
2. Record approver, time, scope, limitations, asset paths and SHA-256 hashes in `approval.yaml`.
3. Set the engagement status to `knowledge_approved` and the current gate to `solution_selection`.
4. Ask whether to invoke `$build-bu-solution` from that approved version.

On revision, apply `revision-control-gate.md`, update the canonical `20_distilled/BRD.html`, increment its draft version, regenerate affected supporting artifacts and repeat validation and review. Never mutate an approved version in place. On pause, retain the approved version without starting solution production.
